ðŸ“§ Spam Email/SMS Prediction using Machine Learning

This project implements a Machine Learning model to classify messages as Spam or Not Spam (Ham). The system analyzes the content of emails and SMS messages to predict whether they are legitimate or potentially harmful. Such models are widely used in email filtering, messaging platforms, and cybersecurity applications.

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

The project follows a complete ML pipeline:

Data Collection

Used a publicly available dataset of SMS/Email messages labeled as spam or ham.

Data Preprocessing

Text cleaning: removed special characters, numbers, and punctuation.

Tokenization and stop-word removal.

Feature extraction using Bag of Words (BoW), TF-IDF, and Word Embeddings.

Model Training

Trained multiple classifiers including Logistic Regression.

Model Evaluation

Compared models using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Confusion Matrix.

ðŸš€ Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, NLTK, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Version Control: Git & GitHub

ðŸ“Š Results

Achieved >96% accuracy with Logistic Regression.

Successfully identified spam messages with strong precision-recall tradeoff.
