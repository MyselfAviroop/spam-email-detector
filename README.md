ðŸ“§ Spam Email/SMS Prediction using Machine Learning

This project builds a Machine Learning model to classify messages as Spam or Not Spam (Ham). The model analyzes the content of emails/SMS messages and predicts whether they are legitimate or potentially harmful. This kind of system is widely used in email filtering, messaging platforms, and cybersecurity applications.

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

The project implements a full ML pipeline:

Data Collection â€“ Used a publicly available dataset of SMS/Email messages labeled as spam or ham.

Data Preprocessing â€“

Text cleaning (removing special characters, numbers, punctuation).

Tokenization and stop-word removal.

Feature extraction using Bag of Words (BoW), TF-IDF, and Word Embeddings.

Model Training â€“ Trained multiple classifiers:

Logistic Regression


Model Evaluation â€“ Compared performance using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Confusion Matrix.


ðŸš€ Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, NLTK, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Version Control: Git & GitHub

ðŸ“Š Results

Achieved high accuracy (>95%) with Logistic Regression .

Successfully identified spam messages with strong precision-recall tradeoff.
